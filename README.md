The Stock and Sales Tracking Automation is developed in C# and integrated with an SQL database. The application greets users with a Login page. The main page features two groupBoxes: Customer Operations and Product Operations, along with a dataGridView for cart functionality.
The application includes buttons for Add to Cart, Complete Sale, Delete (to remove items from the cart), Cancel Sale, Add Customer, List Customers, Add Product, List Products, Add Category, Add Brand, and List Sales.
Customer and product information is automatically filled when their respective numbers are entered. On the Customer Listing page, searches can be performed by customer name or number, and information can be updated. The Product Addition page automatically populates the ComboBox with previously added categories and brand names. In the Brand Addition page, brands can be added to specific categories. The Sales Tracking page allows you to see who purchased a product by entering the barcode number or view the purchases made by a customer using their customer number.
